# Welcome
Here you'll find some pre-defined files that I use in my projects for integration with some modern tools. Feel free to [leave your suggestions](https://github.com/vitorbritto/managers/issues).

## Getting Started

Some files related to these tools, are in a folder called `./src`. I have this habit by organizational issues, and even with some documentation advising the use in the root folder, I performed several tests in these files before I could do this migration.

> Remember, these files works well in my workflow, the way I feel most suited and comfortable. Is up to you (me) if you want to run this as a file or copy paste at your leisure. Feel free to ask anytime or leave some suggestions.

## Installation

> So far, only been tested on OSX.

```bash
$ bash -c "$(curl -fsSL raw.github.com/vitorbritto/managers/master/install)"
```
