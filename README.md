# Welcome

#### WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

Here you'll find some pre-defined files that I use in my projects for integration with some modern tools.

> Note: these files works well in my workflow, the way I feel most suited and comfortable. Is up to you (me) if you want to run this as a file or copy paste at your leisure. Feel free to ask or leave a message.
